This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

Below is a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”.

``` r

Below is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

The resulting data set has 50400 variables and 5 observations in total.
The variables are `week`, `day_id`, `wDays`, `activity_num`, and
`activity_counts`. `Week`, `day_id`, and `day` describes the records the
observation week and day. The `activity_counts`describes activity counts
for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight. `wDay` is a
factor variable that describes weekday vs weekend.

Next, the table shows the total activity counts via aggregation across
minutes for each day.The subject typically alternates the level of
physical activity every other day. In other words, he/she is more active
on one day and less active on the next day. The total_activity for
Saturday week 4 and 5 returns as 1440 results from summing up of every
account count of value “1” during the whole day. The possible reason is
that the subjective didn’t wear/use accelerometer on Saturdays in week 4
and 4 for personal reasons.

``` r
accel %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  summarize(
     activity_total = sum(activity_counts)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = activity_total,
  ) %>% 
  select(week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| week |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday | Sunday |

Below is a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. The
baseline of physical activity across one week is below 2500 every
minute. The subject engaged with more physical activity early in the day
on weekdays while later in the day on Sundays. The possible reason is
that the subject exercises in the mornings on weekdays while exercises
in the afternoons and evenings on Sundays. The subject is active in
approximately fixed periods of time everyday in 5 weeks.

`ny_noaa` dataframe has 2595176 rows and 9 columns, with 9 core
variables for all New York state weather stations from January 1, 1981
through December 31, 2010. Key variables include `id`: Weather station
ID, `year`, `month`, `day`: Date of observation, `prcp`: Precipitation
(tenths of mm), `snow`: Snowfall (mm), `snwd`: Snow depth (mm), `tmax`:
Maximum temperature (C), and `tmin`: Minimum temperature (C). The
dataset contains massive missing values because each weather station may
collect only a subset of these variables.

The most commonly observed values is 0 because for the majority of time
during a year in most places, it didn’t snow. Snow only occurred in
winter so in spring, summer, and fall, it wasn’t likely to snow and the
snow fall would be 0.

Below is two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January
and in July in each station across years. The general pattern of average
maximum daily temperature in each station is similar across years
1981-2010. We see a fluctuations between -10C and 10C in January and
between 20C to \~32C in June where the line graph is darkest due to
overlying. The notable outlier in January is in 1982 where the average
max daily temperature is much lower than -10C. The outlier in July is in
1988 where the average max temperature is below 15C.

``` r
ny_noaa %>% 
  filter(month %in% c("January","July")) %>% 
  group_by(month, year, id) %>% 
  summarize(
    tmax_mean = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = tmax_mean, group = id)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(. ~month) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Max Daily Temp (C)",
    title = "Average Max Temp (C) in each station"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'month', 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

Next is a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a
plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less
than 100 separately by year.

``` r
tmax_tmin_p =
ny_noaa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax))+
  geom_hex(data = ny_noaa) +
  labs(
    x = "Minimum Daily Temp(C)",
    y = "Maximum Daily Temp(C)",
    title = "Hex plot of daily temp extremes",
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

snow_p = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  filter (snow > 0 & snow < 100) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = snow, y = year)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(
    x = "Snowfall(mm)",
    y = "Maximum Daily Temp(C)",
    title = "Distribution of snowfall (0-100mm) by year",
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

tmax_tmin_p + snow_p
